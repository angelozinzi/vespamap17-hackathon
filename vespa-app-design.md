# VESPA Mobile App *Design Sprint*

## Background (why)

TBW

## Objective (what)

The objective of this hackathon is to design and test a prototype for a VESPA mobile app that should includes data search and discovery functionalities on a map.

## Sprint team (who)

Everyone can participate!

A small team of 5 to 7 people would be ideal. The rest of the workshop participants can volunteer to test the prototype the sprint team will have designed.

## Process (how)

We will follow the process and principles of Google Ventures (GV) [Design Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/), which is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.

Wait... but we don't have 5 days.

Indeed. So, we will scale it down to 5 hours. One hour for each design-sprint day. So it's going go fast, we will work hard but it's going to be fun and rewarding!

1. **Map** (Understand): The first hour discussions will create a path for the design hack. You'll *start at the end* and agree to a long-term goal. Next, you'll make a *map* of the challenge. You'll *ask the experts* to share what they know. Finally, you'll *pick a target*: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in 5 hours.

2. **Sketch** (Diverge): After a first hour of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on the second hour, you get to focus on solutions. It starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to *remix and improv*. Then, each person will *sketch*, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry.

3. **Decide**: After the break, you will have a stack of solutions. That's great, but it's also a problem. You can't prototype and test them all. In the third hour, you'll critique each solution, and *decide* which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. Then, you'll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a *storyboard*: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.

4. **Prototype**: On Day 2, you created a storyboard. In the first hour of Day 3, you'll adopt a *"fake it"* philosophy to turn that storyboard into a *prototype*. A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers. You'll also make sure everything is ready for the last hour's test by reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script.

5. **Test**: You'll take everything you've done one step further as you *interview* customers and *learn* by watching them react to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of it, you'll know how far you have to go, and you'll know just what to do next.
